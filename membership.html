                          <b><u>Single</u></b><br>
                          The Single membership is typically for one Adult - resident memberships must have a Santa Clara home address.<br><br>
                          </li>
                
                          <li>
                          <b><u>Family</u></b><br>
                          The primary member (Resident/Non-Resident) pays the family rate.  Each additional member at the same address pays
                          $.99 (99 cents).  Please note that each additional family member must have the EXACT SAME address as the primary member.  For example, if the first family   member lists  39 de Anza Blvd. (with the period) - each succeeding family member must have the same (39 de Anza Blvd.) address.
                          39 DeAnza Blvd. or 39 deAnza will not match. For non-resident family memberships with two adults- each Adult should pay with their own credit card or Paypal account, as payment indicates your signing of the Waiver. Each family member receives the same club benefits. Resident family memberships must have a Santa Clara home address.
                <br><br>
                          In order to get the $.99 rate for additional family members, you must sign up with the <b>Family</b> membership.
                          Non-resident family memberships are limited to two Adults at one address.   
                <br><br>
                After you fill out and submit the form for the primary family member, each succeeding member must fill out another form 
                and follow the same process.  
                Your home address will be matched and you should only be charged
                $.99 (99 cents) at Paypal. If this does not occur, try again with the correct home address. For any questions, email memb@sctennisclub.org.

                         <p><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b><br>
                         The entire membership form must be filled out, except gender and NTRP are optional.
                         After the membership form is completely filled out, clicking the Waiver box will bring up the Paypal button.
                         If the Paypal button doesn't appear, then you missed something! Re-check.
