              SCTC members who are interested in captaining a team must contact the club USTA Representative              
              at least two weeks  prior to the close of team registration, as designated by USTA, to seek 
              permission to run a team.  The earlier the request, the better the chance of board approval.
              <p>
              The SCTC board will then vote to approve which teams will be allowed.
              Due to limitations set by Lifetime Tennis and other factors, not all team
              requests may be granted.   Late requests may be allowed on a case by case basis if there
              is still space available.
              <p>
              <ul>
                 <li>
                 Captains (or a designated representative) must attend all SCTC board meetings,
                 in order to be kept up on city and club requirements.  Currently all board meetings 
                 are conducted online using the <a href="http://www.discord.com">Discord app </a>
                 </li>
              <p>
                 <li>
                 Captains/teams are required to perform some voluntary service for the club during the
                 year.  Examples are helping at club functions such as mixers, running/assisting at club
                 tournaments.
                 </li>
              <p>
                 <li>
                 The board and the captain must mutually agree on what service will be acceptable.
                 </li>
              
              </ul>
              <p>

                 Captains are responsible to make sure that all of their team players are members of
                 Santa Clara Tennis Club <u>before they play their first match </u>. Club members are listed on 
               the <a href="./members">membership page </a>.
              <p>
                 Captains who do not follow these requirements will first be placed on probation, and given
                 an opportunity to address the deficient area.   Captains who do not become compliant with
                 all the requirements within a reasonable time period, as set by the board, will not be allowed
                 to continue as captain at Santa Clara Tennis Center.
