<b>2023 USTA Captain's Agreement</b> </center>

<p>

A USTA Captain running a team out of Santa Clara Tennis Center agrees to the following rules. <p>

<ul>

  <li> Captains must attend SCTC board meetings while they are an active Captain.  If they cannot attend, a team representative may attend in lieu of the Captain.  
Board meetings are typically held online.  You will be notified of the dates in advance. After attending and being
updated on the relevant USTA/Captain information at Santa Clara Tennis Center, you are free to leave.  </li>

 <p>
  <li>Captains must assist in one Mixer event during the year.  There are typically 7 Mixers in a year, all on Saturday.

 The Captain will need to buy a few items  for the Mixer. This may consist of a box of donuts, fruit, granola bars, 1-2 bags of ice, 
soda, or sport drinks.   The expenditures will be reimbursed by the club. The Captain should arrive slightly early for the mixer 
and stay long enough to check in all the participants and collect the fees including from those who arrive late.

<p>
   Other volunteer activities may be offered in lieu of assisting with the Mixers.


   </li>

 <p>

  <li>
       The Captain agrees that all USTA team members will be members of Santa Clara Tennis Club prior to playing a match. Failure to abide by
       this rule will result in the player not being allowed to play in further matches until he/she beccomes a member of the Club. The Board
       will also be made aware of the Captain's noncompliance with the rule, and may place the captain on probation.
      
      Captains can check on the membership of their players on the club roster page at
     <p>
     <a href = "http://www.sctennisclub.org/membership/members">www.sctennisclub.org/membership/members</a>
     <p>

   </li>


  <li>  The Captain is aware that Santa Clara Tennis Club is required to maintain a  50% + 1 ratio of residents/non-residents. 
      Prior to approval to run a team, the Captain may be asked to provide a partial list of USTA team members and their city of residence
  </li>

 <p>


  <li>  The Captain is aware that they are representing both Santa Clara Tennis Center and Santa Clara Tennis Club
       and  appropriate conduct is required of the Captain and  team members.   Any detrimental conduct of the Captain  
       may be grounds for future disapproval as a USTA team Captain.



  </li>



</ul>


<p>
  The Captain's signature below constitutes an agreement to the above conditions. <p>
  This agreement is for 2023 and must be signed annually. <p>
