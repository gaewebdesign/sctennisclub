<b>Captain's Agreement</b> </center>

<p>

A USTA Captain running a team out of Santa Clara Tennis Center agrees to the following rules. <p>

<ul>

  <li> Captains must attend SCTC board meetings while they are an active Captain. 
 If they cannot attend, a team representative may attend in lieu of the Captain.  
Board meetings are typically on Thursday at 6:30 pm at the Santa Clara Central Park Community  Recreation Center, four times a year.  
The dates are posted on the club web site (www.sctennisclub.org).  Prior to the board meeting, an invite will be sent to each Captain.

    <p>  Santa Clara Central Park Community Recreation Center <br>
          969 Kiely Blvd <br>
          Santa Clara, CA 95051<br>
          Phone (408) 615-3140
 <p>
    
After attending and being updated of relevant USTA/Captain information at Santa Clara Tennis Center, they are free to leave.   </li>

 <p>
  <li>Captains must assist in one Mixer event during the year.  There are typically 7 Mixers in a year, all on Saturday.

 The Captain will need to buy a few items  for the Mixer.  
This may consist of a box of donuts, fruit, granola bars, 1-2 bags of ice, 
soda, or sport drinks.   The expenditures will be reimbursed by the club.
<p>
   Other volunteer activities may be offered in lieu of assisting with the Mixers.


   </li>

 <p>

  <li>
       The Captain agrees to always have all USTA team members registered to Santa Clara Tennis Club prior to playing.
     The club member list of current members can be found at
     <p>
    www.sctennisclub.org/membership/members.
     <p>
    Team members must be a member of SCTC before they play a match.  Failure to do so will result 
    in the player not being allowed to play in further matches  until this is rectified as well as the Captain being be brought to the board's attention.

   </li>


  <li>  The Captain is aware that Santa Clara Tennis Club is required to maintain a  50% + 1 ratio of residents/non-residents. 
      Prior to approval to run a team, the Captain may be asked to provide a partial list of USTA team members.


  </li>

 <p>


  <li>  The Captain is aware that they are representing both Santa Clara Tennis Center and Santa Clara Tennis Club
       and  appropriate conduct is required of the Captain and  team members.   Any detrimental conduct of the Captain  
       may be reasons for future disapproval as a USTA team Captain.



  </li>



</ul>
